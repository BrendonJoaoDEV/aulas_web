      <h1>Why do we use it?</h1>
      <p>
        It is a <strong>long established fact</strong> that a reader will be
        <em> distracted by the readable</em> content of a page when looking at
        its layout. The point of using
        <u>Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less</u> normal distribution of
        letters, <mark>as opposed to using</mark>
        <small>'Content here, content here'</small> making it look like readable
        English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use
        Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for
        <sup>'lorem ipsum'</sup> will <sub>uncover many web sites still</sub> in
        their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes
        by accident, <del>sometimes on purpose</del> (injected humour and the
        like).
